    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> Dolma recipe or stuffed grape leaves recipe is so popular in the Mediterranean. Tangy, tender grape leaves wrapped around aromatic rice and cooked to perfection. This old-fashioned recipe is an all-time family and friends favorite, Stuffed grape leaves are commonly served as a delicious appetizer. Almost every nation in the region has its own version. I've tried so many myself, the Greek, Lebanese, Syrian, Turkish and of course the Egyptian.</p>
