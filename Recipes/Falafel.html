    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Falafel is a common form of street food or fast food in Egypt as well as the Levant.<br> The croquettes are regularly eaten as part of meze. During Ramadan, falafel balls are sometimes eaten as part of the iftar, the meal that breaks the daily fast after sunset.<br> Falafel became so popular that McDonald's for a time served a "McFalafel" in its breakfast menu all over Egypt. Falafel is still popular with the Copts, who cook large volumes during religious holidays.</p>
